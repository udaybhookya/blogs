# 📝 My AI & Tech Blog

Welcome to my blog repository! This space is where I write and share articles on topics I’m passionate about — from Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Gen AI!

## 🚀 What’s Inside

1. **Statistical Significance Tests: A statistical way to compare data populations**  
   **Abstract:**  
   This blog explains how to statistically compare data populations using significance tests. It begins by showing the limitations of using mean, median, and visualization tools like box plots and histograms for comparing data similarity. It then introduces Student's t-test as a robust method to measure differences between samples, supported by concepts like t-value, p-value, and hypothesis testing. The blog also outlines when to use variations like paired, independent, and one-sample t-tests. Additionally, it covers Z-test, Chi-square, ANOVA, and KS test, offering a practical guide to selecting the right statistical method based on the data scenario.

3. **How We Met AI: Episode 1 – RNN Encoder–Decoder Revolution**  
   **Abstract:**  
   This post explores how two simple RNNs revolutionized machine translation. We cover the limitations of rule-based systems and basic neural nets, introduce RNNs for sequence modeling, and explain the encoder–decoder approach that turns any-length sentence into a fixed “context vector” before reconstructing it word by word in another language. You’ll also learn training techniques like teacher forcing and why challenges like vanishing gradients led to LSTM and GRU.
