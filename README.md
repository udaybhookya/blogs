Welcome to my blog repository! This space is where I write and share articles on topics I’m passionate about — from Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Gen AI!

## 🚀 What’s Inside

1. **How We Met AI: Episode 1 – RNN Encoder–Decoder Revolution**  
   **Abstract:**  
   This post explores how two simple RNNs revolutionized machine translation. We cover the limitations of rule-based systems and basic neural nets, introduce RNNs for sequence modeling, and explain the encoder–decoder approach that turns any-length sentence into a fixed “context vector” before reconstructing it word by word in another language. You’ll also learn training techniques like teacher forcing and why challenges like vanishing gradients led to LSTM and GRU.
